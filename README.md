# Your First Headless WordPress Project

This starter project is a basic React SPA using React Router that consumes data from your WordPress WPGraphQL API. This repo is a teaching tool for the WP Engine Developer Relations team, or anyone interested in teaching or learning more about headless WordPress patterns.  

This project assumes that you have the following requirements met:
- A WordPress site (Check out [Local](https://localwp.com/) to create a local WP site)
- [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) Plugin
- [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) and [WPGraphQL for ACF](https://www.wpgraphql.com/acf)(optional)
- [WPGraphQL Smart Cache (beta)](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-smart-cache) (optional)
